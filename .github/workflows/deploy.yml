            Hello üëã

            The deployment was aborted due to **unexpected files** being found in the plugin package.

            üì¶ Files not expected based on `.distignore`:
            -------------------------------------------
            ${{ steps.validate.outputs.DIFF_OUTPUT }}

            Please review your plugin directory or update your `.distignore` if these files are valid.
